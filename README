Knowlan is ARP protocol based Local Area Network IP and
MAC Adress Extractor. Knowlan uses libpcap and libnet
libraries for to be simple to handle and to have a simple
code for any interestor to deal with the code. Pre-Stable
Versions of Knowlan did not use libpcap and libnet 
libraries. It used pure link layer system calls to get
settings and generate ARP PACKETs for sending and handling.

However, everything is not so simple. For portability,
It has been found more efficient that if we use a well
known and portable library, we can solve portability problem.
So, It is decided on to use libpcap and libnet libraries 
for sending and handling ARP packets and decide on them
what to do.

As you have already dealt with the program, It has two processess.
One, child enters in a infinite loop for recieving ARP
REPLY packets and then printing IP and MAC Addresses as it 
gets packet from the interface. The second process, our parent,
get a number of maximum possible host in the LAN using netmask.
So, then, it starts sending ARP REQUEST packets to the whole
LAN, every ip, not knowing whether the ip address it sends
the ARP REQUEST packet is up or not.

Arter sending packets to whole LAN, it waits an extra 100msecs. 
for any late host to answer ARP REQUEST. So, after 100msecs 
passed, the send_arp_packet(interface) returns and that process
then sends SIGKILL to the child to inform that there will 
be no other machine to reply. So the child quits. The IP and
MAC addresses associated with them are all active machines
on the LAN. Have fun with them!
